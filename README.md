## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **XOXO.array**! This isn't just your classic Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a modern, web-based version built from the ground up with a focus on a clean user experience, advanced features, and an intelligent AI opponent.

The main goal was to create a polished and enjoyable game using vanilla JavaScript, showcasing how powerful array manipulation can be for managing game logic, state, and even AI decision-making. I started this project as a way to dive deep into front-end fundamentals and build something fun and challenging. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed building it!
